# BioinformHer_Module1_MiniProject
## **PROJECT TITLE**
Comprehensive Sequence Analysis of the Human TNF Gene

## **OBJECTIVE**
To apply bioinformatics skills to download, analyse, and interpret the sequence of the human TNF gene, which encode a proinflammatory cytokine call TNF.

## **PROJECT OVERVIEW**
In this project, a series of Bioinformatics steps were performed on the human TNF gene which can be useful for further biological research. Firstly, data was retrieved from NCBI in FASTA format. Subsequently, the nucleotide sequence was visualized and translated into amino acid with BioEdit tool. The finding of ORFs and analysis of sequence composition was also performed using BioEdit tool.  After that, PROMO tool was used to identify Transcription Factor Binding Sites and MEME Suite was used for finding motifs. At last, coding and non-coding regions were predicted with GENSCAN and the FASTA sequence of TNF gene was concerted to PHYLIP format using BioEdit tool.

Downlaod Module1_MiniProject.zip folder to check the project report, outputs and screenshots.

## **Task 1: Download a Biological Sequence from NCBI and View/Edit it**
In any bioinformatics project, the first step is to download data from reliable sources. So, here the human TNF sequence was downloaded from the NCBI gene database in FASTA format and opened in BioEdit to view and edit it.  

## **Task 2: Generate a Translation of a DNA or RNA Sequence into Amino Acids**
The DNA sequence of the TNF gene was translated into Amino Acids using the Translate function of the BioEdit tool.

## **Task 3: Find ORFs (Open Reading Frames) in a DNA or RNA Sequence**
In any nucleotide sequence, finding a protein coding sequence is the crucial step. As, this protein sequence could be helpful in drug development and designing primers for that region. 

## **Task 4: Analyse Sequence Composition (Nucleotide or Amino Acid Frequencies)**


## **Task 5: Identify Transcription Factor Binding Sites Using the PROMO Tool**


## **Task 6: Search for Functional Motifs in a Genome or Transcriptome Using MEME Suite**


## **Task 7: Predict Coding/Non-Coding Regions in a Genome Using GENSCAN**


## **Task 8: Convert Between Sequence File Formats Using BioEdit (FASTA to PHYLIP)**
The TNF gene sequence was converted from FASTA format to PHYLIP format, aligning the sequences into a fixed-width field suitable for phylogenetic analysis.
